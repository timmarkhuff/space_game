# Space Game

A simple 2D space game built with Pygame. This was my first game, and one of my first Python projects. The concept was inspired by https://github.com/techwithtim/PygameForBeginners. 

I added many features, including:
* Basic physics
* Round-based gameplay wiht increasing difficulty
* Fuel management system
* Currency and purchasable upgrades
* Enemy and friendly AI
* Multiple weapons
